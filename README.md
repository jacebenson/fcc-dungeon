# Dungeon Crawler

This project is to use the skills learned at FreeCodeCamp.

The stories from this project are listed on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-roguelike-dungeon-crawler-game).

Below I've listed them incase that changes;

1. User Story: I have health, a level, and a weapon. I can pick up a better weapon. I can pick up health items.
1. User Story: All the items and enemies on the map are arranged at random.
1. User Story: I can move throughout a map, discovering items.
1. User Story: I can move anywhere within the map's boundaries, but I can't move through an enemy until I've beaten it.
1. User Story: Much of the map is hidden. When I take a step, all spaces that are within a certain number of spaces from me are revealed.
1. User Story: When I beat an enemy, the enemy goes away and I get XP, which eventually increases my level.
1. User Story: When I fight an enemy, we take turns damaging each other until one of us loses. I do damage based off of my level and my weapon. The enemy does damage based off of its level. Damage is somewhat random within a range.
1. User Story: When I find and beat the boss, I win.
1. User Story: The game should be challenging, but theoretically winnable.

```
